# Hello, World!

This is the first post to test the system.

## Blog posts

All blog posts are written in Markdown syntax and kept in a GitHub repository at
https://github.com/thecodesmith/blog-content.

## Syntax highlighting

The blogs should have all the usual Markdown formatting, including inline code
and code blocks with syntax highlighting.

Inline code looks like this: `println 'Text'`.

Sample code from a Grails domain class:

    class Entry {
        String title
        String content
        Date datePosted

        static belongsTo = Author
        static hasMany = [tags: Tag, comments: Comment]

        String toString() { title }
    }

## TODO

There are a number of features and improvements that I would like to make to the
site over time. Some of the ideas I have right now:

* A Groovy shell
* Vim
    - Integrated Vim editor
    - Current Vim cheatsheet
    - .vimrc link to GitHub
    - Current plugins list with links
* Reading list of books
* Contact page
* Integrate some front-end Javascript, and perhaps a full single-page
  architecture decoupling the front-end from Grails entirely

There are plenty more ideas, but I'll add more later as time permits.
